<p>Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.</p>
</br>
<p>For example, the following two linked lists: </p>
<pre>
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
</pre>
<p>begin to intersect at node c1.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns. </li>
<li>You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.</li>
<li>Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.</li>
</ul>
